This directory contains the UPPAAL files for the paper:
"Timed Automata for Modelling Caches and Pipelines", MARS Workshop
Franck Cassez and Pablo González de Aledo Marugán
	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04172

The files simple-prog-*.xml contain the examples of Figugues 1, 2 and 3.

The files in simple-prog-mars-{union, product} contain the caches computed by our
abstraction refinement strategy. This is the computation for simple-prog-mars.xml.

In union, the refinement at iteration n is unioned with the refinement at iteration n - 1.
In product, the refinements are kept as different machines.

Notice that the executables to compute the refinements are not provided in this distribution.
Contact the authors if you want to get the (C) sources.
